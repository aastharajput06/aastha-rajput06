          <!-- I’m a Graduate Student in Computer Science at The George Washington
          University (SEAS), graduating in December 2025. Passionate about
          software engineering, AI, and web development, I’m seeking Summer
          2025 internships and full-time roles to create impactful
          solutions.<br /> -->
          I'm a Software Engineer and M.S. Computer Science graduate from The George Washington University, specializing
          in full-stack development and cloud architecture. My expertise lies in designing, deploying, and optimizing
          scalable systems using technologies like React, Node.js, Python, and AWS.

          I thrive in agile environments, having led teams and mentored junior developers, and I have a proven track
          record of delivering features that drive user engagement, streamline operations, and generate significant revenue.

          I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges, from building AI chatbots to
          automating FinOps reporting.

          <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm
          probably sleeping, binge-watching my favorite shows, or crossing off
          another item on my bucket list.
