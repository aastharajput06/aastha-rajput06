#   description: An online version of my 2016 resume I made for fun. I was interested in learning React.js, so I found this <a class="underline-link" href="https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/building-your-first-react-js-app-d53b0c98dc#.1439cdewq">simple tutorial</a> and it kind of spun into this weekend project. I probably didn't need to use React at all, but hey, at least I learned a few things!
